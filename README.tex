\maketitle

\texttt{fountain-parser} is a small parser library for the
\link{https://fountain.io/}{Fountain} screenplay format,
supporting 1.1 version
\link{https://fountain.io/syntax/}{syntax} and
producing a simple, easy to grok \textsf{AST}.

\texttt{fountain-parser} is written in
\link{https://haskell.org}{Haskell} and it uses the
\link{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec}{Megaparsec}
library for parsing.

\section{Motivation}
The Fountain authors have implemented a 
\link{https://github.com/nyousefi/Fountain}{parsing library}
in \textsf{Objective~C}. Portability would be an issue here:
there \emph{are} projects that make it possible to connect
Objective C to Haskell, but they're either platform or
framework-specific.  Their library also employs a multi-pass
stategy where every stage creates a modified version of the
source, and it's heavily reliant on \emph{Regular Expressions}.

Thus, to create a light-weight, performant and portable
solution, it's necessary to start from scratch --- an opportunity
the author relishes.

\section{Implementation Specifics}
Fountain files are \textsf{UTF-8} text files. While this library
doesn't impose any file naming scheme, it is customary for Fountain
files to have the extension \texttt{.fountain}, \texttt{.txt} or
\texttt{.spmd} (the latter for historical reasons.)
